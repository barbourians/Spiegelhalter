## Ox man
David Spiegelhalter wrote about a man named Francis Galton. 
In 1907, Galton went to the Stock Fat and Poultry Exhibition in Plymouth  where he saw a large ox displayed and contestants paying sixpence to guess the 'dressed' weight of the resulting meat after the poor beast had been slaughtered. 

Galton managed to get hold of 787 of the tickets that had been filled out, and he chose the middle value of 1,207lb as the democratic choice. The dressed weight turned out to be 1,198lb which was remarkably close to his calculation.

Galton wrote to the prestigious science journal Nature and titled his paper

## Guess the number of jelly beans
Unfortunately I don't have an ox with me today, but like ... I do have a jar of jelly beans!

So what I would like you to do is to write down on a piece of paper the number of jelly beans that you think are in this jar. It isn't a trick question and it doesn't matter if your guess is way off. Just guess the number of jelly beans in this jar. it's quite large, weighs 1.8kg (sorry I don't know what that is in pounds) and is about 30cm/12 inches(?) tall.

## YouTube
About 9 years ago ... posted the same question on YouTube and asked his followers to write their answers in the comments. Fortunately for me I managed to find the video and I scraped the data from the comments; put it into Excel, cleaned it up and ended up with a file of ... guesses. I will now add your guesses to that data, add a column heading, and then we have a dataset to work with.
